My academic advisor is Amos Storkey. I am a member of the Institute for Adaptive and Neural Computation . \r\n\r\nMy research interest is between machine learning models and optimization, specially on how to apply stochastic methods and multi-agent mechanism into parallelising machine learning models to handle massive data. Recently I has been looking at fast methods for optimization in deep learning, and Langevin dynamics for large-scale Bayesian sampling. \r\n",
